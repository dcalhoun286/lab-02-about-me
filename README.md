## About Me

I built a webpage to help people become more familiar with who I am. As a developer, for this project I wanted to create some fun prompts that engages the user regarding information contained in my page.

### Feature Tasks
* Create 5 prompts that require a Y/N answer regarding the content of the web page.
* Ensure to include personalized messages so the user feels like they are directly interacting with the developer who created the page.

### Reflections and Comments

**01 December 2020**
* It was so easy for me regarding this project to fall in the rabbit hole. It was a good lesson on prioritization of deliverables so that I accomplish the most crucial things in a timely manner.
* My table mates admonished me to discontinue waiting so long to ACP my changes. This is going to be one of the things of utmost importance to improve on as I continue creating projects in the future.
* W3 Schools really came through for me in figuring out many CSS rules that I either previously never learned, or needed another example to better conceptualize how to use that rule.
