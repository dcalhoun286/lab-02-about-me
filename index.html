      <h3 id="whoiam" class="subheading">A Snippet of Who I am</h3>
      <p>I am originally from the Tri-Cities area of Eastern Washington. I come from a big family on my mother's side: While I am the oldest of only three children, I have over 80 cousins!</p>
      <p>I have been living in Seattle for a little more than a decade. I at least for the time being can't imagine going elsewhere, so I suppose you could say I consider this my home!</p>

      <h3 id="edu" class="subheading">My Education History</h3>
        <ul class="unordered">
          <li>In December 2016, I successfully completed my training at King County Medical Services to become eligible to take the exam to certify as a Nationally Registered Emergency Medical Technician (NREMT). In January 2017, I passed that exam, and in March 2019, I renewed my status as an NREMT. As per the requirements to maintain status as an NREMT, I also have a certification through the American Heart Association called <abbr title="Basic Life Support">BLS</abbr> for Healthcare Providers.</li>
          <li>I attended college at the University of Washington Seattle campus from September 2008 until December 2012, where began pursuing a degree in Biology, and later on during my time there, Human Geography (with a focus on globalization and health). Due to personal circumstances, I was unable to finish this leg of my educational journey, but I nonetheless have gained valuable knowledge from my time there that I undoubtedly continue to use today.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3 class="subheading">A Couple Goals That I have</h3>
      <ul class="unordered">
        <li>
          <h3 class="goals">Become a Rockstar Developer!</h3>
          <p>I am a softwear developer training at Code Fellows in Seattle. The experience I have had here has and will continue to kick my butt, but I know that what is truly rewarding comes with hard work, tenacity, patience, and kindness to myself and others. When I graduate from Code Fellows and jet off into the industry, I want to look back at my time here and know that I can be proud both of my willingness to push past the challenges to grow. I want to be able to say that I took to heart the things that I learned to not only grow my skillsets as a software developer, but apply my experience to being a better human being in my life while making a difference in the community around me.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 id="goals" class="goals">Become a Better Plant Mom</h3>
          <p>This may sound silly, but it is true: I want to become a better plant mom! In early 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic began to force social distancing as the &ldquo;new normal&rdquo;, I found myself doing a lot of gardening to keep my attention focused on something positive. Some plants along my learning curve indeed were sacrificed, but alas, I did not give up. In my spare time, I enjoy reading about the different types of plants that I have and their care needs to keep thriving. I'd say I'm getting pretty good at it &mdash; you might even say I'm a bit of a plant nerd &mdash; but, as with everything else, there is always more to know, and there are always areas of improvement. In a way, learning how to nurture and be kind to my plants has pushed me to remember to nurture and be kind to myself, which is crucial for persevering through burdensome circumstances in life. My favorite plant to take care of so far is the <dfn><em>Pilea peperomioides</em></dfn>, colloquially known as the Chinese money plant.</p>
